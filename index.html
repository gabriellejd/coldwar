<h4> <strong>Introduction</strong>
</div>
  History is best defined as the study of past affairs particularly in human affairs. From early as 1st grade, children learn about social studies which raises their awareness on past events that came before them. This foundation is vital throughout their entire lifetime since all future events will eventually relate to previous events from the pass. Personally, ever since elementary school I’ve always loved history and have always found significance in learning about events that came centuries
  before my time. Afterall, how can we progress in the future if we don’t know a single thing about events that came before us. Isn’t the whole point of history is to bring awareness of past events in order to make once inevitable situations preventable in the future?

<h4> <strong>Personal exerience with topic</strong> </h4>
</div>
In my sophomore year of high school I took my first AP class which was AP European History. As stated earlier, I’ve always found joy in learning history so I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that I would be taking this course. Despite the fast pacing lessons, I still enjoyed learning new things everyday which gave me great satisfaction. Although, towards the end of the year we didn’t focus on the Cold War compared to other topics such as the French Revolution or the Thirty Years’ War and even World War I & II. At the time, my teacher gave the class a thick packet which consisted of key components about the Cold War. However, looking back I noticed that I didn’t take the packet as seriously as I should’ve. Yes, I read the entirety of it but I focused on getting the answers correct rather than fully understanding what the Cold War was truly about. Even though my AP course is over and it is currently summer, the fact that I never grasped what went on during the Cold War is genuinely bothering me which is why I am here today to tell you why the cold war is just as important as learning about world war II. Afterall, history never stopped after World War II ended. If you’ve learned so much it wouldn’t hurt to understand what took place after this catastrophic event
Cold War Definition- Time period that started right after WWII, as early as 1945. During this hostile time period there were tensions between the USSR with its satellite states and the United States of America with its WWII allies. The tensions between the USSR and the United States of America was geopolitical as they both sought after global supremacy.

<h4> <strong>Background</strong> </h4>
</div>
  Following World War II, the Cold War began. The world was in total destruction as an aftermath of this catastrophic war. Many of the dominating countries that were in the frontline of WWII were left economically damaged. Such countries included Germany, France and Britain. The last two remaining powers that didn’t suffer as much from the war was the Soviet Union and the United States of America. Many have speculated that the Cold War officially began when Winston Churchill, Britain’s former Prime Minister, announced that there was an iron curtain that divided the East from the West as well as their ideologies. The East represented the Soviet Union and her satellite states and the West represented the United States of America and her allies. Such allies included France, Japan, Canada and Britain. While the USSR and the United States never engaged in a battle directly, they fought through Afghanistan, Korea and Vietnam. However, don’t get the idea that the Cold War was a physical
  battle. Afterall, World War II just ended and neither of these two powers were in a position to physically engage in war. Instead, this war was more of a competition on who was more surprised. Such actions that proved superiority included who could reach to the moon first, sporting events and spying.

<h4> <strong>Containment</strong> </h4>
</p>

<p>
  Many believe that the United State’s best tactic during the Cold War was containment. Containment is best explained as the United States’ policy of using various strategies to prevent the expansion of Communism. The policy of containment was a direct response to the Soviet Union’s influence on Eastern Europe, China, Korea, and Vietnam. As former United States president Harry Truman once said to congress in 1947,”It must be the policy of the United States...to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation…by outside pressures.”

<h4> <strong>Nuclear Arms Race</strong> </h4>
</div>
  Many United States officials pushed the idea of developing several atomic weapons similar to those in WWII. As a result, the Soviet Union tested an atomic bomb of their very own. Consequently, President Truman announced that the United States would be developing an atomic bomb that would be more destructive, known as the “superbomb”. This Atom Age even took a toll on the lives of people everywhere. Many Americans decided to build bomb shelters in their backyards and bomb drills took place in schools and public areas.

<h4> <strong>The Race to Space</strong> </h4>
</p>
<img src="spacerace.jpg" alt= image width=300 height=200 </img>
<p>
On October 4, 1957, a Soviet missile called the “traveling companion” was launched into space which was the world’s first artificial satellite as well as the first man-made  object to be placed into Earth’s orbit. This was a big surprise to many Americans. As a result, in 1958, the United States launched its very own satellite in space. That very same year, President Dwight Eisenhower signed a public order which started NASA. NASA was a federal agency that was dedicated to space exploration and the potential exploitation of the military aspect of space. Despite the United States efforts, the Soviet Union had the upper hand since they launched the first man in space in April 1961. One month later America launched its very own first man in space. After this event, former president John F.Kennedy publicly announced that the United States would land a man on the moon before the decade ended. That plan came to pass when Neil Armstrong became the first man to set foot on the moon in July 1969. This ultimately meant that the U.S won the Space Race.

<h4> <strong>What the Cold War Was Like Abroad</strong>
</div>
In June of 1950 the first military action was taken during the Cold War. This was when the Soviet-backed North Korean People’s Army invaded South Korea which was a place where the people and their government was pro western. The American government felt like it was their obligation to intervene in this situation thus President Truman sent the American military into Korea. However, this wasn’t the only dispute between the two powers. The early 1960s proved that Communism has spread to the Western Hemisphere when the Bay of Pigs Invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis took place.

<h4> <strong>State of Peace</strong> </h4>
</p>

<p>
</div>
As soon as President Richard Nixon held the title of presidency, he carried out a new approach with regards to international relations. He suggested the use of diplomacy as a way to deal with the international relations between the USSR and the United States. He encouraged the United Nations to recognize the communist Chinese government and even took a trip there to improve relations. Eventually, Nixon developed the policy of detente which was the easing of hostility between the USSR and the USA. In 1972 Nixon and Soviet premier Leonid Brezhnev signed SALT I which prevented the manufacture of nuclear missiles from both powers. This ultimately was a step taken which would reduce the threat of nuclear warfare.
<p>
<div>
<h4> <strong>End of the Cold War</strong> </h4>
</div>
Even though Nixon went to great lengths to reduce hostility between the United States and the USSR, President Ronald Reagan made it known that the spreading of Communism would result in the lost of freedom everywhere. Due to that ideology, Reagan worked to provide financial and military aid to anticommunist governments. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union itself was disintegrating. The USSR was facing economic problems and political changes so as a result , Premier Mikhail Gorbachev implemented two policies known as glasnost and perestroika. However, such efforts didn’t improve the political and economic state the Soviet Union was in. In addition, many of the USSR’s satellite states broke away from communism and the USSR itself. Consequently, in 1989 the Berlin Wall fell down which signified the potential fall of the Soviet Union. Finally, in 1991 the Cold War ended when the Soviet Union collapsed.

<h4> <strong>Why Learn About the Cold War Anyways?</strong> </h4>
</p>

I hope that the information I’ve given was helpful. Many of you may be wondering what’s the significance of learning about the Cold War anyways. As a history geek myself, I find it rather entertaining to learn about the relations between major powers after WWII. What I’m trying to convey is that learning about the Cold War is quite amusing. But what about those who loathes history and learning about events that came before their time? My perspective on this is that learning history is rather inevitable. Throughout every teenager’s high school career they’d have to learn about the Cold War anyways so why not start with learning about the basics. As a student, I know that sometimes I don’t enjoy reading long websites that goes into the specifics of every single history. Instead, I believe that in some cases, simplified and broad information is quite simple. I am aware that this website doesn’t go down to the nitty gritty details about the Cold War but that was actually the whole point. Furthermore, I feel that learning about the Cold War is just as important as learning about World War II because WWII wasn’t the last historical event after all. Why stop learning the historical curriculum at one topic when there is so much more to learn. Lastly, I hope that this website inspires you to learn outside of what you’re being taught. It makes no sense to limit yourself when we live in the age of technology where we have access to an abundance of information with just a click of a button. Learning is a great and satisfactory experience so expand your horizon and research whatever you’re interested in even though it was never taught to you.
